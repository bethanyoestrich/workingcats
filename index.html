        <h2>what is a workINg cat?</h2>
        <p>Simply put, a working cat is a cat that lives outside of a traditional home setting and provides rodent control in exchange for food and a safe place to call home. Your average working cat is very independant and generally prefers an rugged outdoor lifestyle. Depending on your specific job description and needs, cats can have varying "people skills" and can range personality wise from very social to rugged pioneer kittys that prefer limited human contact. Cats available for working placement have entered one of the many shelters across Indiana and often times face potential euthanasia if not for working cat programs. The cats placed into working cat programs from the below listed program come employment ready and are spay or neutered, vaccinated, eartipped and ready to work. </p>

        <h2>How to introduce a working cat to your property </h2>
        <img src=pictures/relocation_crate.jpg alt ="reloaction crate">
        <p>When the cats arrive at their new home, a large wire dog crate will be set up and the cats will be transferred from carriers into their relocation crate.  Food, water and litter box will be set up at this time, if you are providing your own supplies please have them handy prior to the arrival of the cats.<br>
Prior to the arrival of your new working cats, please locate an area inside the barn or building you want them to reside in. This area should be somewhere convenient for you to feed and clean the cats easily for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>During the relocation period, feed, provide fresh water and scoop the litter box daily. Most cats will stay at the back of their crate or inside their feral den and will not try to escape, but please use caution when opening the crate. If you have been provided with a feral den, you will be shown how to operate it at the time of drop off.  While you feed, talk to the cats and make “kitty kitty” calls so that the cats will begin to associate the sound of your voice with food.</p>

<p..At the end of the acclimation period, simply leave the crate or barn door open and allow the cats to come out at their own pace. Leave the crate in place and continue feeding nearby. Often the cats will use the crate or feral den to sleep in. After they have been released, continue to provide cat food and water daily. Cats cannot live on mousing alone and will need to continue to receive daily food.
